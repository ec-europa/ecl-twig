# ECL-Twig Resources

[ECL-Twig Js website:](https://ecl-twig-js.netlify.app/) the interactive style guide that renders the twig templates, it includes `knobs` for the input data manipulation and offers a valid include code for the component in the `notes` tab.

[ECL-Twig Php-Js website:](https://ecl-twig-php.netlify.app/) a static version of storybook, built programmatically by rendering the components with twing (js) and twig (php)

- it shows a diff between the markup generated via js and php in the `diff` tab.
- if available, it also shows a concise report from `ecl-diff-full` about the results of the check in the `ecl-diff` tab.

The full report by `ecl-diff-full` for each release is available in the `docs/ecl-diff/{system}/{version}.md` file.
